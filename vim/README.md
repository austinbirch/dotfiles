#My vim configuration.

## Keeping plugins up to date (without Vundle commands)

Although Vundle is used to manage the vim plugins, it shouldnâ€™t be used directly
as it does not play well with submodules. Instead, add a git submodule to the
```vim/bundle``` directory, add the entry to the ```Bundle``` section in
```vimrc```, and then commit the changes.

When vim is restarted, the plugin should work without having to use any of the
Vundle commands (i.e. ```:BundleInstall```).
