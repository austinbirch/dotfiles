To get tarsnap running (MAC OS X):

BEFORE MOVING MACHINE:
- make sure you have a backup of the tarsnap key!

Reconfigure:
- install tarsnap via 'brew install tarsnap'
- move tarsnap-backup into '/usr/local/bin/'
- create cron job ('sudo crontab -e') with the contents of 'cron'
- make sure '/usr/local/bin' is in your PATH
- ensure that the tarsnap key is in the correct place (check tarsnap.conf)
